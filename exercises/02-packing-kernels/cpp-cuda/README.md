# Exercise 02: Packing Kernels and Non-Blocking Communication

## Task: Replace Multiple Blocking Messages with a Packing Kernel

### Description

The starting point `packing.cpp` performs a ring-shift communication between
GPUs: each rank sends `num_messages` small messages (each `msg_size` elements)
to its right neighbour and receives from its left neighbour, repeating for
`num_iters` iterations.  Because the messages are non-contiguous in GPU memory
(they are spaced `stride` elements apart, with the gap representing local data
that is not communicated), each individual MPI call can only send `msg_size`
elements at a time.

The code contains **two timed approaches** so that the benefit of packing can
be measured directly:

1. **Blocking baseline** (already implemented): a loop of `num_messages`
   blocking `MPI_Sendrecv` calls per iteration, one per message.  This incurs
   `num_messages` separate MPI latencies per iteration.

2. **Packing + non-blocking** (TODOs): a CUDA kernel packs the `num_messages`
   strided messages into a single contiguous buffer, one `MPI_Isend` /
   `MPI_Irecv` pair communicates the packed buffer, `MPI_Waitall` completes
   the transfer, and another CUDA kernel unpacks the received buffer back into
   the strided layout.

Once the TODOs are implemented, both approaches should report `correct: yes`
and the printed speedup shows the benefit of packing.

Once you are familiar with the code, please work on the `TODO`s in
`packing.cpp`:

1. Implement the `pack_kernel` that gathers `num_messages` strided messages
   into a contiguous buffer.
   * Each thread copies one element:
     `dst[m * msg_size + i] = src[m * stride + i]`.
   * The total number of threads needed is `num_messages * msg_size`.
1. Implement the `unpack_kernel` that scatters a contiguous buffer back into
   the strided layout.
   * Each thread copies one element:
     `dst[m * stride + i] = src[m * msg_size + i]`.
1. In the packing loop (Approach 2), replace the TODO comments with:
   * Launch `pack_kernel` to gather `d_send` into `d_send_buf`.
   * Synchronize the GPU (`cudaDeviceSynchronize`) so the packing is complete
     before the MPI call.
   * Post `MPI_Isend` (`d_send_buf` to `next`) and `MPI_Irecv` (`d_recv_buf`
     from `prev`) into an array of two `MPI_Request` objects.
     * The signatures are
       ```cpp
       int MPI_Isend(const void *buf, int count, MPI_Datatype datatype,
                     int dest, int tag, MPI_Comm comm, MPI_Request *request);
       int MPI_Irecv(void *buf, int count, MPI_Datatype datatype,
                     int source, int tag, MPI_Comm comm, MPI_Request *request);
       ```
   * Wait for both requests with `MPI_Waitall`.
   * Launch `unpack_kernel` to scatter `d_recv_buf` into `d_recv`.
   * Use GPU-aware MPI, so the send and receive buffers are located in GPU
     memory.  Use the defined `MPI_REAL_TYPE`.

### Build and run commands

* First make sure you have loaded appropriate modules.  For the Nvidia A100s in
  CSD3 (`ampere` partition), the modules are in
  [`csd3-modules-cpp-cuda.sh`](../../csd3-modules-cpp-cuda.sh) and can be loaded
  with
  ```bash
  source ../../csd3-modules-cpp-cuda.sh
  ```
* Build with
  ```bash
  make
  ```
* You can run a quick test interactively (assuming you are on a node with
  Nvidia GPUs) to check it runs without crashing:
  ```bash.
  make test
  ```
* To run on the compute nodes:
  ```bash
  make run
  ```
